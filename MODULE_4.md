# Module 4 - Mina Protocol 

 In this module, you will start getting used to o1js and Mina protocol. Now, as you saw in Module 0, size of the blockchains increase in various reasons. This is not the case for Mina Protocol, since it has a constant size of 22 kBs! Lets try to understand why it is in that way.

Now that you have an understanding about Mina, you can start checking these materials for 
-  [o1js Introduction](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/o1js)
-  [Tutorials for ZkApps](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/tutorials)

We highly recommend you to check the codebase and see how the types implemented and try to build somethings. This is the brest way to understand the smart contracts in Mina. For learning the o1js basics in a structured way, you can use [Mina Playground](https://www.minaplayground.com/) tutorials.

There are some backbone classes and functions in o1js that makes Mina Universal ZK proof Layer. Field and curve operations are shown in the first exercise.
