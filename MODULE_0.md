# Module 0 - Blockchain basics

Hello. We're happy that you are ready to dive in to Mina Protocol and start to solve problems related blockchain. Now, in this module, you will learn blockchain basics before learning what Mina Protocol is. If you already feel that you know how blockchains work, you can just go to Module 1. However, you can come back here to check resources about topics that you feel lack of through your process. Letz go!

## What is a Blockchain? 

Lets begin with some videos necessary to grasp the details of blockchain (not so technical yet):

## What is a Blockchain, again? 

Continuing with the father of all blockchains, Bitcoin. Understanding the applications and implementations of the concepts above in blockchain can give you some understanding about blockchain as well. Please go and see:

- [Public & Private Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zyKvPvh808)
- [Blockchain and Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcuc3rgwZAE&t=660s)
- [How does Bitcoin work? by 3B1B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)
  
  Please use the book [Programming Bitcoin by Jimmy Song](https://digilib.stekom.ac.id/assets/dokumen/ebook/feb_d82be9cf1cb52e2b294a82275318a5c8235444eb_1654093256.pdf). It is very pedagocial in terms of showing the implementation of necessary building blocks of a blockhain -Well,       Bitcoin actually-. Implementations are done with Python, so anyone with an understanding of algorithms can understand it.

  You might ask: What are the use cases? Well, we would like to respond like this:
