# Module 3 - zkSNARKs

This module is where zero-knowledge proofs and Snarks are going to be explained. You are not supposed to know Zk proofs deeply, but understanding some key terms like *witness* *Public Input* and *Private Input* is essential while you develop zkApps. First, see what [ZK proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uchjTIlPzFo&list=PLS01nW3Rtgor_yJmQsGBZAg5XM4TSGpPs) are in a mathematical sense, since it is essential for your further development understanding the underlying mathematics



## 2. SNARKs

First, start by what is a circuit? By circuits, we mean **Arithmetic Circuits**:
- [Electric Coin article](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain5/)
- [What is a SNARK by Dan Boneh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-94UhJLeck)
- [What is a zkSNARK by Dan Boneh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcKCW7CNu_M)
- [A Gentle Introduction to Snarks](https://www.di.ens.fr/~nitulesc/files/Survey-SNARKs.pdf) This one is a little mathematical, but checking the SNARK parts might give you a hint about it.


## 5. Additional Study

In the above, we have drawn very heavily from blog posts written by Vitalik Buterin, Electric Coin, and Maurizio Binello. However, these are only some of the many pathways towards understanding zkSNARK construction.

Since it is always helpful to take a look at the same problem from different angles, we recommend you visit the following resources:

- [**Why and How zk-SNARK Works**](https://medium.com/@imolfar/why-and-how-zk-snark-works-1-introduction-the-medium-of-a-proof-d946e931160) (highly recommended) - Originally [**a paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07221) by Maksym Petkus, it dives into the specifics of how a zkSNARK is constructed, it has been converted to a series of blog posts for easy consumption.
- [**ZK Whiteboard Sessions**](https://zkhack.dev/whiteboard/) - ZkHack explains various topics in a nice and clear way. Use those resources in case you want to learn deeper.
